For this to work with the project it was designed for, one would have to open the "CMPS441FPS.exe" application,
which is a manually played game scene made on unity engine. An AI played such game is also available here on
"intelligent_game.exe". Both the games have to be opened in 800x600 screen and will have to be dragged to the
top left part of the screen. Also, this application requires a dependency on python 2.7.13 and opencv 2.

CMPS441FPS.exe was the work of Justin Mclin
intelligent_game.exe AI was the work of Brian Martinez
Vision implementation was done by Yashmin Sainju
